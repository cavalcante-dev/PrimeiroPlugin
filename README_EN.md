# PrimeiroPlugin - My First Minecraft Plugin

Welcome to the **PrimeiroPlugin** repository, my first plugin developed for **Minecraft Java Edition (Version 1.21.5)** servers. This project is part of my practical studies in the Udemy course on Minecraft plugin development, taught by **Stephen King**.

## üìñ About the Project

This repository contains a basic Minecraft plugin created to learn the fundamentals of plugin programming using **Java** and **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**. The project serves as a testing ground for applying concepts learned in the course, such as:
- Creating custom commands.
- Handling Minecraft events (e.g., player actions, entities, etc.).
- Configuring YAML files for customization.
- Integration with the Spigot/Bukkit API.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Features

- **Compatibility with Minecraft 1.21.5**: Designed to work with the latest version of Minecraft Java Edition.
- **OOP-Based**: Organized structure following Object-Oriented principles.
- **Customizable Configuration**: YAML files for adjusting messages and behaviors.
- **Practical Examples**: Simple commands and events to demonstrate learned concepts.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important:
As this is a learning project, the plugin's functionalities will constantly evolve. I will document all changes in the project's update notes.

## üìö Prerequisites

To use or contribute to this plugin, you will need:
- **Java JDK 17+**: Version compatible with Minecraft 1.21.5.
